                    <h4>Why Use Family Health Share?</h4>
                    <p> &emsp;&emsp;Why use this application? Often enough it can be difficult when you go to the doctor and the doctor asks
                        about your family health history. You might have heard that an aunt, or cousin had high blood pressure, or maybe a great grandmother
                        had cancer. A lot of the times, many members of your family might have fragments of this information. This is where Family Health
                        Share comes in. By having different family members pool their health history knowledge everyone might get a better understanding
                        of the overall family health history</p>
